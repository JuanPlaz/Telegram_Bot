This code is a Python script that uses the schedule module to schedule a task to run at a certain time every day. The task is to get the price of Bitcoin from a web page and send the message with the price through a Telegram bot.

First, the following libraries are imported:

BeautifulSoup from the bs4 module: It is used to extract information from a web page through its HTML code.
requests: It is used to make HTTP requests to a web page.
Next, the bot_send_text function is defined that sends a message through a Telegram bot. To do this, the Telegram API is used to send an HTTP request with the message to be sent. The function receives the message to be sent as a parameter and returns the response from the Telegram API.

Next, the btc_scraping function is defined, which is responsible for obtaining the price of Bitcoin from the web page. To do this, an HTTP request is made to the web page and BeautifulSoup is used to extract the price from the HTML code of the page. The function returns the price in text format.

Finally, the report function is defined, which is responsible for sending the message with the price of Bitcoin through the Telegram bot. To do this, call the btc_scraping function to get the price, and then use the bot_send_text function to send the message with the price.

In the if __name__ == '__main__': block, the schedule module is used to schedule the task of sending the Bitcoin price message at 11:29 every day. The task runs in an infinite loop that checks if there are any tasks pending execution.
